                      <h3> What could be better???</h3>
					  <p> AppleJacks are the best cereal known to man. 
					 They are wonderful with every bite, and provide enough sugar to definitely affect ones health. 
					 They come in many different sizes at the grocery store and come in many different prices. 
					 There is also alot of different recipes that you can make with this cereal.
					 No other cereal comes close to how perfect AppleJacks are, and food critics from all over the world have claimed that it is the best way tp start ones morning.
					 You can even put them in your coffee for a little extra kick.
					 You can even give them to the entire family so nobody is left out in the morning. 
					 AppleJacks are the best cereal in the world.
					
					 <p>

                         <h3> Other wonders of the world of breakfast cereal </h3>
						<p> Although, AppleJacks breafast cereal is the best cereal there are other wonderful options as well.
						Coming in a close second is Captain Crunch. Captain Crunch cereal is awesome and has many health benefits such as pure happiness with every bite.
						Captain Crunch cereal can also be eaten dry as a lovely snack on the go. Everyone should try this at least once in their lives. 
						Cereal is also great with other liquids such as orange juice and even almond or oat milk if you cannot have milk. Cereal is one of the best breakfast items in the world and Captain Crunch holds the number two spot.
						We will talk about more in the next couple of paragraphs.
						</p>
                    
                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add three (3) paragraphs of text. -->
						<h3> Other Great Breakfast Cereal Options </h3>
						<p> In the third spot we have Frosted Flakes. Frosted Flakes are a cereal made from corn meal and coated in a nice layer of frosting. This will then sweeten the milk and make it better to drink.
						I have also seen people make different types of dishes with frosted flakes such as rice cripsy treats, cakes, and even drinks. Frosted flakes is another awesome breakfast.
						The fourth spot comes to the one and only rice crispy cereal. Rice crispy cereal has been around since the dawn of time and has been in the hearts of many for years. They come in many different flavors such as chocolate and frosted.
						These also make really good ingredients to other dishes such as rice crispy treats and other desserts. The final spot for the best breakfast cereals is Shredded Wheat. This cereal is awesome because it has the perfect balance of sweetness.
						Shredded Wheat is just rolled wheat squares coated in a frosting. Once milk is applied, the cereal starts to melt and mix with the milk to create a lovely texture. This brand of cereal also comes in many different flavors such as strawberry and chocolate.

                    <h3> Cereal Bar Options </h3>
					<img src="images/CerealBar.jpg" alt="Cereal bar">
					<p> Cereal bars are also great options if you don't have time for a whole bowl of cereal in the morning. They come in a variety of healthy flavors with many different brands.
					I would highly reccomend this to any white collar worker or anyone that is super busy in the morning. It is easy to throw into a bag or into a cup of coffee to start your day.

                    <h3> Types of Milk </h3>
					<img src="images/Milk.jpg" alt="Milk">
					<p> Milk can pair well with almost any cereal, however, some pair better than others. With the help of almond milk you can add some nutty flavor that can go very well with different brands of cereal.
					You can also use 2% if you dont want to consume all of the unnecessary milk fat. You can also use soy or oat if you are lactose intolerant.

					<img src="images/Extras.jpg" alt="Extras">
					<p> Sometimes you arent sure what you want to consume in the morning before work, but that is okay. In this section I will talk about other delicious options that are super easy to eat in the morning.
					Donuts are a perfect quick grab option in the morning for consumption on the road. They come in bunch of different flavors and are made with many different ingredients. Muffins are also a great option that come in tons of different flavors as well.
